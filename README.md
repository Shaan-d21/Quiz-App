# Quiz-App
This is a quiz app created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as part of my internship task at Sync Intern.  It gives a score to the user at the end of the game, if the score is above a threshold value you declare the player to be a winner, using some gifs corresponding to winning and losing the game.
