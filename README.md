# Quiz-App
This is a quiz app created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as part of my internship task at Sync Intern.  
It gives a score to the user at the end of the game, if the score is above a threshold value you declare the player to be a winner, using some gifs corresponding to winning and losing the game.

How to use :
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your favorite code editor.
3. Run the app by typing npm start in the terminal.
4. The app will open in your browser.
